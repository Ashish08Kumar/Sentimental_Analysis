# Sentimental_Analysis
Sentiment analysis is an NLP technique to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. In a Python-based sentiment analysis project, you collect labeled data, preprocess it, extract features, train a machine learning model, evaluate its performance, and deploy it for real-time sentiment analysis.
